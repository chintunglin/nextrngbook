# NextRNGBook: A Python Random Number Generation Package

The **NextRNGBook** package incorporates a variety of high-quality random number 
generators (RNGs) from 
*Random Number Generators for Computer Simulation and Cyber Security* [[1]](#references). 
Designed for seamless compatibility with **NumPy**, 
this Python package integrates easily into existing workflows, 
offering a selection of state-of-the-art random number generation techniques 
suitable for scientific computing, large-scale simulations, and cryptographic tasks.
