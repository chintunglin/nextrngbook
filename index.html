<h1 id="nextrngbook-a-python-random-number-generation-package-for-rng-book">NextRNGBook: A Python Random Number Generation Package for RNG Book</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of <strong>NextRNGBook</strong> package is to incorporate a variety of high-quality random number 
generators (RNGs) from 
<em>Random Number Generators for Computer Simulation and Cyber Security</em> <a href="#references">[1]</a>. 
Designed for seamless compatibility with <strong>NumPy</strong>, 
this Python package can integrate easily into existing workflows, 
offering a wide range of selections from state-of-the-art random number generation techniques 
suitable for scientific computing, large-scale simulations, and cryptographic applications.</p>
<p>The goal of designing high-quality random number generators is to produce variates 
that behave like truly random numbers. 
This means the generated variates can cover the space evenly over high dimensions, 
and do not repeat for a very long time. 
They can be generated efficiently across different systems, 
and they can pass a wide range of statistical tests that detect hidden patterns. 
A good RNG should perform reliably for large-scale simulations with 
a strong support for parallel computing, 
and an easy integration across various computing platforms. 
For security applications,  generated variates need to be unpredictable, 
so that future values cannot be inferred from past outputs.</p>
<p>There are several  high-quality RNGs to be implemented in this NextRNGBook Package which should provide a solid foundation 
for better statistical simulation and/or secure applications. 
Combining strong theoretical supports and great practical performance, 
NextRNGBook can help users to explore, evaluate, and 
apply high-quality RNGs in a modern Python environment.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-motivation">Background and Motivation</h2>
<p>This section provides needed background information about RNGs to be used 
and explains the motivation behind both the package and the proposed RNGs.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-recursive-generators">Multiple Recursive Generators</h3>
<p><strong>Multiple recursive generators (MRGs)</strong> have become one of the most commonly 
used random number generators in computer simulation. 
An MRG is defined by a <span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span>-th order linear recurrence relation:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
X_i = (\alpha_1 X_{i-1} + \alpha_2 X_{i-2} + \dots + \alpha_k X_{i-k}) \mod p, \quad i \geq k \tag{1}
\]</div>
<p>where the modulus <span class="arithmatex">\( p \)</span> is a large prime number, 
and the initial seeds <span class="arithmatex">\( X_0, \dots, X_{k-1} \)</span> are integers in 
<span class="arithmatex">\( \mathbb{Z}_p = \{0, 1, \dots, p-1\} \)</span>, 
not all of which are zero.</p>
<p>A common way to obtain variates <span class="arithmatex">\( U_i \)</span> 
between 0 and 1 is to apply the transformation</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
U_i = \frac{X_i}{p}.
\]</div>
<p>To improve statistical and numerical properties, 
Deng and Xu <a href="#references">[2]</a> recommended the following modification:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
U_i = \frac{X_i + 0.5}{p}.
\]</div>
<p>This modification can offer several advantages: 
(i) it prevents the generation of exact values of 0 or 1, 
thus avoiding issues in applications like generating a random variable 
with a standard exponential distribution using <span class="arithmatex">\( X = -\ln(U) \)</span> 
or a logistic distribution using <span class="arithmatex">\( X = -\ln(U/(1-U)) \)</span>;
(ii) the average value of <span class="arithmatex">\( U_i \)</span> is closer to <span class="arithmatex">\( \frac{1}{2} \)</span> 
because the output range is symmetric around <span class="arithmatex">\( \frac{1}{2} \)</span>. See, the paper by
Deng and Xu <a href="#references">[2]</a>. To produce a 32-bit integer variate, say, we can simply 
scale <span class="arithmatex">\( U_i \)</span> by <span class="arithmatex">\(2^{32}\)</span> 
using the floor function <span class="arithmatex">\( Y_i = \lfloor U_i \cdot 2^{32} \rfloor \)</span>. </p>
<p>The <strong>period length</strong> of an RNG
refers to the number of iterations (or random numbers generated) 
before the sequence repeats itself. Every RNG eventually enters a cycle, 
starting to produce the same sequence of numbers again after a certain number of steps. 
For the MRG, the maximum period is given by <span class="arithmatex">\( p^k - 1 \)</span>, 
which is achieved if and only if its characteristic polynomial </p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
f(x) = x^k - \alpha_1 x^{k-1} - \alpha_2 x^{k-2} - \cdots - \alpha_k 
\]</div>
<p>is a primitive polynomial which can be checked using proposed algorithms in <a href="#references">[3, 4, 7]</a>.</p>
<p>A maximal period MRG has a nice property of  <strong>equidistribution</strong> 
in spaces up to <span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span>-dimensions, 
Specifically, according to 
Lidl and Niederreiter [1994, Theorem 7.43]  <a href="#references">[8]</a>, 
for <span class="arithmatex">\(1 \leq d \leq k\)</span>, </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>every non-zero <span class="arithmatex">\(d\)</span>-tuple <span class="arithmatex">\((a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_d)\)</span> appears the 
<em>same number</em> of times (<span class="arithmatex">\(p^{k-d}\)</span>) over its entire period <span class="arithmatex">\(p^k-1\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all-zero <span class="arithmatex">\(d\)</span>-tuple <span class="arithmatex">\((0, 0, \cdots, 0)\)</span> 
appears <em>one times less</em> (<span class="arithmatex">\(p^{k-d}-1\)</span>).</p>

</ul>
<p>This would imply the random numbers are uniformly distributed across dimensions <span class="arithmatex">\(d\leq k\)</span>. 
This uniformity helps reducing correlation artifacts, 
which can improve the accuracy of simulations, 
especially in high-dimensional spaces. 
<strong>Empirical tests</strong> have been tested on several maximal period MRGs with great results. 
In summary, a large order MRG will yield an extremely long period by modern standards, 
it has a nice equidistribution property over high dimensional space, 
and it can pass stringent extensive empirical tests.</p>
<h3 id="linear-congruential-generators">Linear Congruential Generators</h3>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\( k = 1 \)</span> in Eq. (1), the MRG reduces to a <strong>Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)</strong>.
The sequence is given by:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
X_i = (B X_{i-1} + A) \mod p, \quad i \geq 1 \tag{2}
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="arithmatex">\( X_i \)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\( A \)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\( B \)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\( p \)</span> are nonnegative integers, 
and <span class="arithmatex">\( X_0 \neq 0 \)</span> is chosen from <span class="arithmatex">\( \mathbb{Z}_p \)</span> as a seed. 
If <span class="arithmatex">\( A \neq 0 \)</span>, it is possible to achieve a full period of <span class="arithmatex">\( p \)</span>.</p>
<p>It is common to use <span class="arithmatex">\( A = 0 \)</span> because it offers faster computation and 
clear properties. In this case, the sequence is described by:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
X_i = B X_{i-1} \mod p, \quad i \geq 1 \tag{3}
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="arithmatex">\( X_0 \neq 0 \)</span>. 
When <span class="arithmatex">\( p \)</span> is a prime number and <span class="arithmatex">\( B \)</span> is a primitive root modulo <span class="arithmatex">\( p \)</span>, 
the LCG in Eq. (3) has a period of <span class="arithmatex">\( p-1 \)</span>.</p>
<p>Until recently, LCGs enjoyed popularity for their simplicity, 
efficiency, and well-known theoretical properties. 
However, they are now considered less ideal due to their relatively short periods by modern standards, 
as well as their inability to achieve equidistribution in dimensions greater than one. 
Furthermore, LCGs also show poor empirical performance, 
failing to pass rigorous statistical tests.</p>
<h3 id="pcg64-permuted-congruential-generator">PCG64: Permuted Congruential Generator</h3>
<p>LCG is the baseline RNG used in the popular
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/bit_generators/pcg64.html">PCG64</a>
which is designed to address some of the inherent shortcomings of LCGs. Specifically, 
PCG64 uses a 128-bit LCG with <span class="arithmatex">\( p = 2^{128} \)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\( A \neq 0 \)</span> in Eq. (2), 
dividing 128-bit output into two 64-bit outputs,
appling permutation and combination transformation to produce 64-bit (or two 32-bit) generated values. 
This permutation and combination, along with the high-bit modulus, 
helps improve the generator’s empirical performance. It was shown that 
PCG64 can pass stringent statistical tests whereas traditional LCGs often fail.
However, since its baseline structure is still based on an LCG, 
it is expected to inherit the same limitations of LCG. 
In particular, it can not achieve equidistribution in higher dimensions, 
and its period, with an upper limit of <span class="arithmatex">\( 2^{128} \)</span>, is relatively short for 
modern applications that demand longer sequences. 
Furthermore, its reliance on 128-bit unsigned integers introduces 
portability concerns, as not all platforms support such high-bit operations.</p>
<p>We should note that the modulus used by PCG64 is <span class="arithmatex">\( p = 2^{128} \)</span> in Eq. (2) 
is not a prime number whereas the modulus <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> used
for LCG or MRG is a prime number which can be of size with 32-bit or 64-bit outputs. 
Large order MRGs in Eq. (1) do not require 
additional generation time for permuation and/or 
combination transformation as required by PCG64. 
Comparing with PCG64, however, the MRGs 
required expensive modulus operation. 
Next, we will consider an efficient class of MRG to speed up its generating time.</p>
<h3 id="dx-generators-a-class-of-efficient-mrgs">DX Generators: A class of efficient MRGs</h3>
<p>The MRG achieves good theoretical properties, 
does not require any output transformations, 
and avoids reliance on high-bit arithmetic. 
However, as the order <span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span> in Eq. (1) increases, 
two challenges emerge: 
(1) a loss of efficiency due to the increasing number of multiplications, 
and (2) the difficulty of selecting parameters that yield the maximum period length.</p>
<p>The <strong>DX-k-s</strong> class of generators is an efficient subclass of the MRG, 
in which the number of nonzero coefficients is restricted to <span class="arithmatex">\( s \)</span>, 
and all nonzero terms share the same multiplier <span class="arithmatex">\( B \)</span>.
The <span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span>-th order linear recurrences for <span class="arithmatex">\( s = 1, 2 \)</span> are given by:</p>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\( s = 1 \)</span>:</p>
<p>$$
  X_i = (X_{i-1} + B X_{i-k}) \mod p, \quad i \geq k
  $$</p>
<p>When <span class="arithmatex">\( s = 2 \)</span>:</p>
<p>$$
  X_i = B(X_{i-1} + X_{i-k}) \mod p, \quad i \geq k
  $$</p>
<p>where 
<span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span> represents the order of the recurrence relation, 
<span class="arithmatex">\( s \)</span> specifies the recurrence structure, 
<span class="arithmatex">\( B \)</span> is the multiplier, 
and <span class="arithmatex">\( p \)</span> is the prime modulus.</p>
<p>With appropriate parameter choices, 
the DX generators satisfy the <strong>HELP</strong> properties proposed 
by Deng <a href="#references">[2, 3]</a>, 
making them suitable for a wide range of applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>H</strong>igh-dimensional equidistribution: 
The maximal period DX generators ensure high-dimensional equidistribution up to <span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span> dimensions. 
Specifically, every <span class="arithmatex">\( d \)</span>-tuple (where <span class="arithmatex">\( 1 \leq d \leq k \)</span>) of integers 
between 0 and <span class="arithmatex">\( p-1 \)</span> appears exactly <span class="arithmatex">\( p^{k-d} \)</span> 
times across the entire period <span class="arithmatex">\( p^k - 1 \)</span>, 
except for the all-zero tuple, 
which appears one less time, i.e., <span class="arithmatex">\( p^{k-d} - 1 \)</span>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E</strong>fficiency: 
By limiting the number of nonzero coefficients and using a shared multiplier, 
DX generators reduce the computational cost while maintaining high-quality outputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>L</strong>ong period length: 
With appropriate parameters, 
DX generators can achieve the maximum period <span class="arithmatex">\( p^k - 1 \)</span>, 
which is more than sufficient for most simulation scenarios even with moderate order <span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P</strong>ortability: 
DX generators avoid high-bit arithmetic and output transformations, 
making them easy to implement across various platforms 
without compromising performance or statistical quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Deng <a href="#references">[4]</a> proposed an improved efficient search algorithm called GMP 
for finding maximal period MRGs of large order. 
With the Algorithm GMP, the maximum period parameters for DX generators can be found, 
achieving a period length of <span class="arithmatex">\( p^k - 1 \)</span>, 
<span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span>-dimensional equidistribution, 
and great empirical test results.</p>
<p>Deng et. al. <a href="#references">[5]</a> also proposed a method for automatically constructing maximum-period MRGs 
from a single DX generator. 
Using this method, multiple distinct maximal-period MRGs 
can be found and then assigned to different threads or processors for parallel simulations. 
This approach is more effective than traditional methods, 
such as "jump-ahead parallelization."</p>

of the RNG book <a href="#references">[1]</a>. 
<strong>Section 3.1</strong> discusses the advantage and challenge of large order MRGs, 
and <strong>Section 3.2</strong> provides an explanation of the DX generator. 
Parallelization of the DX generator was introduced in 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-76722-7_8">Chapter 8</a>, 
with the classical method covered in <strong>Section 8.1</strong> 
and the advantage of the proposed method in <strong>Section 8.2.2</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="dldsdtdw-generators">DL/DS/DT/DW Generators</h3>
<p>The <strong>DX generator</strong> is an efficient MRG 
with its generating speed and nice statistical properties. 
However, it has two potential limitations: 
(a) bad initialization effect, 
where a near-zero state may result in a prolonged sequence of zero values, 
and (b) suboptimal spectral test results in dimensions higher than <span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span>. 
These limitations arise from the generator's design, 
which prioritizes efficiency by using a minimal number of non-zero terms 
in Eq. (1). 
This so-called bad initialization effect is rarely encountered in practice. 
Unless the initial state is deliberately chosen to be nearly zero, 
it is extremely unlikely for the generator to enter such 
problematic states during typical use. 
Moreover, DX generators have passed stringent empirical tests, 
indicating that their overall statistical quality remains strong in practice.</p>
<p>To address these potential limitations while ensuring efficiency, 
the <strong>DL</strong>, <strong>DS</strong>, and <strong>DT generators</strong> 
were developed by incorporating additional non-zero terms in Eq. (1). 
While the DL generator improves initialization behavior, 
its spectral performance in dimensions higher than <span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span> remains somewhat limited. 
The DS and DT generators enhance both initialization behavior 
and spectral properties, offering a more balanced and effective solution. 
Like the DX generator, all three maintain desirable statistical properties. 
For more details on these generators, 
refer to <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-76722-7_3">Chapter 3</a>
of the RNG book <a href="#references">[1]</a>, 
where <strong>Section 3.2.5</strong> provides the motivation behind the efficient generators.</p>
<p>The <strong>DW generator</strong> 
was developed to tackle two significant challenges 
faced by MRGs with numerous non-zero terms: (1) computational inefficiency 
due to the large number of multiplications required, 
and (2) difficulties in parallelization, 
particularly with traditional methods such as "jump-ahead parallelization." 
The DW generator addresses these challenges by utilizing a 
Matrix Congruential Generator to efficiently implement 
maximum-period MRGs with a large number of non-zero terms. 
This approach ensures both strong statistical properties 
and efficient parallel execution, 
providing a practical solution for high-order MRGs with numerous non-zero terms.
For more details on the DW generator and its motivation, 
refer to <strong>Section 3.3</strong> of 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-76722-7_3">Chapter 3</a>

<h3 id="security-consideration">Security Consideration</h3>
<p>In cryptographic applications, 
the security of a stream cipher depends entirely on the quality of its key stream. 
A truly random key stream would result in ciphertext that
behaves like a random sequence of variates, 
making it extremely difficult for attackers to decrypt 
without knowing the key stream. 
However, truly random sequences cannot be generated by deterministic algorithms, 
the best that we can hope is to contruct some well-designed <strong>secure RNGs</strong>.</p>
<p>A secure RNG should have a long period, 
strong unpredictability (in both forward and backward directions), 
excellent statistical properties, 
high efficiency, 
and a simple, flexible design. 
While many linear generators (such as MRGs) 
perform well in statistical simulations, 
they are not considered as secure. 
Their linearity allows attackers to predict future values by solving recurrence relations 
from a few observed outputs. To address this,  <strong>SAFE</strong> (Secure And Fast Encryption), 
Deng et al. <a href="#references">[6]</a> proposed to use two shuffle tables 
with injection of two good RNGs with nonlinearity transformation and 
mutual shuffling technique to resist attacks.</p>
<p>There are several other popular secure RNGs/ciphers proposed in the literature. 
For example, <strong>RC4</strong> is a popular 8-bit RNG
and <strong>HC-256</strong>, <strong>ChaCha/Salsa</strong> and <strong>Rabbit</strong> are popular secure ciphers 
which are among the finalists in eStream Project.
Most of the proposed RNGs applied ARX (Addition, Rotation, and XOR) operations 
to produce ''randomness'' and ''unpredictability''.
Consequently, one major weakness of these secure RNGs is lack of 
theoretical support for statistical properties. </p>
<p>To address this, in the RNG Book, 
we propose to inject a good RNG to the existing popular secure ciphers 
which incorporate 
nonlinearity transformation and additional techniques to resist attacks. 
For example,  <strong>eRC</strong> is an enhancement to <strong>RC4</strong> 
with 32-bit or 64-bit variates in its shuffle table.
Similar idea can be used to enhance <strong>HC</strong> with <strong>eHC</strong> 
by injecting two good RNGs to the two shuffle tables.

<h2 id="current-features-of-nextrngbook">Current Features of NextRNGBook</h2>
<p>In its current version, the package features the <strong>32-bit DX generator</strong> and 
provides parallelization capabilities. 
Specifically, the package offers over <strong>4,000 distinct DX generators</strong> 
with desirable properties, allowing users to assign different generators to different threads 
or processors for parallel simulations. This approach is more effective than those used in 
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/parallel.html">NumPy</a>, 
such as <code>jumped</code> or <code>spawn</code>, 
where a single RNG with different starting seeds may lead to overlaps and high correlations. 
Different combinations of <span class="arithmatex">\( B \)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\( p \)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\( k \)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\( s \)</span> in the DX generator 
effectively mitigate these issues, enabling better parallelization.</p>
<p>There are wide range of DX generators can be selected with <span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span> 
(from <span class="arithmatex">\(k=2\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(k=3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\cdots\)</span>, up to  <span class="arithmatex">\(k = 50,873\)</span>) and <span class="arithmatex">\(s\)</span> (<span class="arithmatex">\(s=1\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(s=2\)</span>). 
There are several selections of prime modulus <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> which can be of size 
<span class="arithmatex">\(31\)</span>-bit or <span class="arithmatex">\(32\)</span>-bit. 
The period length ranges from approximately <span class="arithmatex">\(10^{18.7}\)</span> to <span class="arithmatex">\(10^{474729.3}\)</span>. 
There are many more parameters <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span>'s can be found for a given DX-<span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span>-<span class="arithmatex">\(s\)</span>. 
In the future, we will also ''extend'' the proposed RNGs in several directions, 
with an even larger order <span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span> and/or  increase the size of <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> 
from 32-bit to 64-bit for various RNGs later (e.g. DX-64).</p>
<h2 id="nextrngbook-expansion-plans">NextRNGBook Expansion Plans</h2>
